### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior-level Ruby on Rails developer with a recent focus on Rails 7, Hotwire, and Stimulus. I also have a working knowledge of React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

While I'm completely in love with the Ruby on Rails ecosystem (especially since the release of Rails 7), I'm constantly learning new technologies and trying to find new and better ways of doing things. Newer languages such as Go and Elixir are especially exciting to me!

Feel free to check out my repositories for an idea of what I work on in my free time:

- [Mood Music](https://github.com/MoodIndustries), a company that I co-founded providing access to underground music curated by a machine-learning algorithm
  
- [GText](https://github.com/whoislewys/GText), which won the Google Services category at a 2019 hackathon at University of Arizona
  
- [encryption_methods](https://github.com/SamRond/encryption_methods), a Python project I undertook to implement RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography from scratch so I could better understand how they work
  
- [kick-help](https://github.com/whoislewys/kick-help), a site to evaluate Kickstarter projects with a Python/ML backend and React frontend developed for a hackathon in 2018
